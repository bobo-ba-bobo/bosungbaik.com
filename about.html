      <h1>What's up these days</h1>

      <section>
        <p>When one has a lot of curiosity, often times it's very difficult to dive into one area deeply and feel like I actually know and own that field of knowledge. I envy those who find what they are the most passionate about and become professionals. I also look up to the many who juggle around multiple areas of interest, find points of integration, and bring out the synergy.</p>

        <p>There are several things I want to become. As a Buffett fan, I want to have the practice of investing not in just a stock or any other asset but in great businesses. As a wannabe early adopter, I want to absorb as much pioneer technologies and be in the frontier of the evolving world. As a fan of many young founders, I want to aid in their journey of building in any way possible. As an individual with many great friends, I want to build a community where passionate friends can freely share their ideas, updates, and insights.</p>

        <p>Too many goals but little focus is my biggest challenge. What I hope to do for the next several years is to start focusing on each idea one by one. Building a community could be just making many friends. Studying businesses and aiding young founders could be my occupation. Absorbing early tech could be in place of my hobbies. Let's see how things are realized, how I grow, and what I ultimately become!</p>

        <p>If you are curious of my journey, let's get coffee!</p>
